"Multi-class-Dog-Breed-Classification" 

This project's aim is to identify the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition, https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data.

Features of this project include some information about the data:

1. We're dealing with images (unstructured data), so it's probably best we use deep learning or transfer learning.
2. There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).
3. There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels).
4. There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels because we'll want to predict them).
